## 💡 Introduction

React hooks are functions that enable you to use state and other React features in functional components. They promote cleaner, more maintainable code and help you manage component logic more efficiently. This guide provides essential information on each hook and shows how to use them effectively in your projects.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this guide, you can clone the repository and follow the instructions provided in the documentation. Ensure you have the necessary environment set up for developing React applications.

## 🔍 Core Hooks

### 1. useState

The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components, enabling you to store and manage values that can change over time.

### 2. useEffect

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in your components, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or manipulating the DOM.

### 3. useReducer

The `useReducer` hook is designed for managing complex state logic in functional components, allowing you to handle state transitions in a more structured way.

### 4. useCallback

The `useCallback` hook helps to memoize functions, preventing unnecessary re-renders of components that depend on those functions.

### 5. useMemo

The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize values, optimizing performance by avoiding expensive calculations on every render.

### 6. useRef

The `useRef` hook creates mutable references that persist for the lifetime of the component, allowing you to directly interact with DOM elements or keep a mutable variable.
